# about me
I'm crazy about software development, the process, the people, the technology, the potential, everything about it! I love learning, meeting, teaching, debating all things related to dev.

I have been lucky enough to build two great teams from the ground up. I made plenty of mistakes along the way but we struck an amazing recipe at [Movio][movio] and managed to build an outstanding team.  It's all a little selfish to be honest - I've successfully managed to surround myself with brilliant people who can challenge me every day.


### philosophies:
Not really philosophies more random ideas that have stuck with me:

* Continuous improvement - in everything
* Embrace failure - can't have continuous improvement without a safe environment to try new things
* It takes longer to make something (product, interface, code, document) clean, simple and elegant than it does to blurt it out
* Focus on your strengths
* Don't hire the best person for the job - hire the right person


### tech:
My wife tells me I have a problem and need to see someone regarding how much time I spend here:

* Scala - I come from Java and have fallen for FP - loving it
* Big Data stuff - particularly [cassandra][cassandra] and [spark][spark]
* AngularJS - love the testability
* TTD - love it!
* Continuous Int / Deploy
* linux, vim, git, colemak
* a mountain more - but lets keep it brief


### community:
I organise and/or speak at a bunch of meetups:

* [NZ Scala][nz-scala]
* [Functional Programming Auckland][fp-auck]
* [Kiwi Coderetreat][kiwi-retreat]
* [NZ Big Data][nz-big-data]
* [Cassandra Auckland][cass-auck]


### in the past:
I love start up environments however in the past:

* Tech Lead - Big Telco
* Security - Consulting Firm
* IT Manager - ended up on the cover of [CIO magazine][cio]
* Couple of degrees - Computational Engineering and Operations Management


## other
My family are a big part of my life. My amazing wife takes most of the load - did I mention she's amazing. Three young kids keep me on my toes - Joseph, Charlotte and James. Best kids in the world - I'm a little biased. Learnt a ton from my 3 y/o about managing developers :) We attend [Life Church][life] in Auckland.

I've been around long enough to have done a little sport - I love a challenge:<br>
surfing (~20 years), paddle boarding, kitesurfing, windsurfing, alpine skiing (rep), football (rep), ice hockey (rep), ironman (11 hours 33 mins of fun...), sailing and some more
